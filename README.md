### Course : Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More! by Jonas Schmedtmann

The project it's a landing page for a fictional company that offers tours in the nature.

The website it's a very animated with a modern look, fully responsive. 

It uses only HTML and Sass(CSS) with SCSS syntax, no CSS framework added.

The CSS architecture structure uses component-based design, BEM and writing reusable code.

The project uses many modern CSS techniques to create stunning designs and effects like: clip-path, gradient color text, gradient color icon, rotating card animations , box-shadow, hamburger menu, background video, reusable custom buttons with push effect, outline effect, custom form and radio buttons, popup box, etc.

The webpage structure uses a custom Grid with floats, no Flexbox and CSS Grid is used here.
